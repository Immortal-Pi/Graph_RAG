Your job is to analyze the provided context chunk (delimited by ```) and extract the ontology of terms mentioned in the context. These terms should represent the key concepts based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Key Terms**:\n",
    "   - While analyzing the context, identify key terms from each sentence or paragraph.\n",
    "   - Key terms may include:\n",
    "     - Objects\n",
    "     - Entities\n",
    "     - Locations\n",
    "     - Organizations\n",
    "     - Persons\n",
    "     - Conditions\n",
    "     - Acronyms\n",
    "     - Documents\n",
    "     - Services\n",
    "     - Concepts, etc.\n",
    "   - Ensure the terms are as **atomistic** and specific as possible.\n",
    "   - Ensure to give response only in JSON format and no other texts or anything to indicate the format\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Relationships**:\n",
    "   - Terms mentioned in the same sentence or paragraph are typically related.\n",
    "   - Each term can have one-on-one relationships with other terms.\n",
    "   - Determine how terms are related to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Relationships**:\n",
    "   - Clearly identify the nature of the relationship between related terms.\n",
    "   - Use concise and descriptive language to explain the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format:**\n",
    "- Provide your output as a list of JSON objects, with a maximum of 5 term pairs.\n",
    "- Each object should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `\"node_1\"`: A concept extracted from the context.\n",
    "  - `\"node_2\"`: A related concept extracted from the context.\n",
    "  - `\"edge\"`: A concise sentence describing the relationship between `node_1` and `node_2`.\n",
