Your job is to process the provided context chunk (delimited by ```) and extract an ontology of terms that represent key entrepreneurs, their associated entities, and all kinds of relationships present in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for Extraction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Key Entrepreneurs and Related Terms**:\n",
    "   - Extract key entrepreneurs and related concepts such as:\n",
    "     - Companies, organizations, or industries they are associated with.\n",
    "     - Collaborators, partners, rivals, or competitors.\n",
    "     - Key innovations, achievements, or milestones.\n",
    "     - Locations, events, or time periods relevant to their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Relationships**:\n",
    "   - Extract all types of relationships between entrepreneurs and other entities (or between entities themselves).\n",
    "   - Relationships can include:\n",
    "     - Professional roles or associations.\n",
    "     - Business partnerships, collaborations, or rivalries.\n",
    "     - Innovations or contributions to industries.\n",
    "     - Personal connections or influences.\n",
    "     - Historical events or shared milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Relationships**:\n",
    "   - Clearly specify the nature of each relationship in simple and concise terms.\n",
    "   - Relationships should convey meaningful connections relevant to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response Format**:\n",
    "- Provide your output **strictly as a list of JSON objects**. No additional text, descriptions, or comments are allowed.\n",
    "- Each object should include the following fields:\n",
    "  - `\"node_1\"`: The first entity in the relationship (can be a person, organization, or concept).\n",
    "  - `\"node_2\"`: The second entity in the relationship.\n",
    "  - `\"edge\"`: A concise sentence describing the relationship between `node_1` and `node_2`.\n",
